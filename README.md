## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The dataset used in this project was provided as part of the TripleTen Business Intelligence program and simulates real-world retail operations. The project addresses three major areas:

1. **Profit & Loss Trends**
2. **Advertising Optimization**
3. **Returned Items Analysis**

The data was cleaned and joined in Tableau, and all visualizations were created in the Tableau Desktop environment before being published online.
